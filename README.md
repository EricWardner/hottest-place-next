## About
One day it was really hot out and I wanted to know if it could possibly be hotter anywhere else in the
country. I tried to google it but there weren't any good results! Then I went down the weather data API
rabbit hole... Here's my attempt


**Might be deployed here at any given time...**

## How does it work?
So this current iteration works by grabbing the NOAA hourly `METAR` data set located here `https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/cycles/`


#### METAR "METeorological Aerodrome Reports"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR


METAR reports are weather blurbs that come from pretty much every runway in the U.S. and maybe the world, 
I'm not sure, there's a lot.
